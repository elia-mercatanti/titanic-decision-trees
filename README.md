# Predicting Survival on the Titanic with Decision Trees
Project for the contest of Multivariate Analysis and Statistical Learning (MASL) - Predicting Survival on the Titanic with Decision Trees

In this project, we build predictive models based on Decision Trees that answer the question, "What kind of people were most likely to survive?" 
using passenger data (e.g. name, age, gender, socioeconomic class, etc.) and being able to predict which passengers on the Titanic survived or not.

Developed in R and with Jupyter Notebooks.
